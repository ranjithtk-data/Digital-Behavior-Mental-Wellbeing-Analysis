📊 Digital Behavior & Mental Well-Being Analysis
An end-to-end data analytics project exploring the impact of screen time, lifestyle habits, and social media behavior on mental well-being using SQL and Power BI.

This project is something I personally enjoyed doing because it connects two areas we all deal with every day: technology and mental health.
I wanted to understand how our daily digital habits — screen time, social media usage, and lifestyle patterns — affect how we feel.

I used SQL to dig into the data and Power BI to turn the insights into a clean, interactive dashboard.

🧩 Why I Did This Project
We all use our phones constantly. Some days we feel fine, other days we feel drained — and we don’t always know why.

So I wanted to answer questions like:

-Does more screen time make us stressed or less happy?
-Does taking a break from social media actually help?
-How much does sleep or exercise matter?
-Do different platforms (Instagram, YouTube, etc.) affect us differently?

This project helped me understand those patterns using data instead of assumptions.

📂 What’s in the Dataset

The dataset contains 500 users with details like:

Daily Screen Time (hours)
Sleep Quality
Stress Level
Happiness Index
Exercise Frequency
Days Without Social Media
Platform Used
Age & Gender

It’s a great dataset because it mixes digital behavior and lifestyle habits, which makes the analysis more meaningful.

🛠 Tools I Used
SQL Server → To explore, clean, transform, and analyze the data
Power BI → To build dashboards and visualize relationships
GitHub → To host and document the project

🧪 What I Did in SQL

I used SQL to understand the data step by step:
-Checked averages, minimums, maximums
-Created new columns like screen-time category and age group
-Compared platforms
-Studied how exercise affects stress
-Analyzed how detox days impact happiness
-Prepared everything for visualization

All SQL queries are included in Analysis.sql.

📊 Power BI Dashboard

📍 Page 1 — Digital Behavior Overview

This page shows:
Key indicators (average screen time, happiness, stress, sleep)
How screen time affects well-being
Which platforms people spend the most time on
Filters so you can explore the data by age, gender, or screen-time category

📍 Page 2 — Lifestyle & Well-Being Insights
This page focuses more on habits and emotional well-being:
Stress levels based on exercise frequency
How taking a break from social media affects happiness
Relationship between screen time and happiness
How sleep quality influences well-being
A small insights box to summarize findings

⭐ What I Learned (Key Insights)
Here are the patterns that stood out clearly:

More screen time usually means more stress and less happiness.
People with moderate screen time (3–6 hours) seemed the happiest overall.
A short social media detox (1–6 days) actually boosts happiness.
The more someone exercises, the less stressed they are — simple but true.
Good sleep is one of the strongest influencers of happiness.
Instagram users had the highest screen time; LinkedIn/Twitter users tended to have better happiness levels.

These insights felt very relatable because we see these behaviors around us every day.

🏁 Final Thoughts

This project taught me a lot — not only about SQL and Power BI but also about digital habits in general.
The biggest takeaway is that balance matters.
Moderation in screen time, good sleep, regular exercise, and taking occasional breaks from social media can make a real difference in how we feel.

I genuinely enjoyed working on this, and I hope the dashboard provides helpful insights to others as well.
